To see the analysis code do something interesting, use the following command:

    python analysis.py ~/data/twitter/apr3-rt.bz2

The code reads the data and prints out some fields. For more information about
what can be found in the tweets, see the field guide
[https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects].


To the Ocaml code do something interesting, first invoke the makefile, then use the following commands:

I)  bz2archive.bz2
    output.txt
where the bz2archive.bz2 is the name of your compressed json data set of tweets; output.txt is a serialized
hashtable mapping tweets to retweets
II) ./populartweets 
           bz2archive.bz2 
	   htbl.txt 
	   histogram.txt 
	   fathtbl.txt 
	   unfilteredoutput.txt
	   filteredoutput.txt
where the bz2archive.bz2 is the name of your compressed json data set of tweets;
htbl.txt is an input file generated by the prior invocation of twitsParser; histogram.txt is 
a popularity frequency distribution; fathtbl.txt is the file to which popular tweets and retweets--
with full text and other datums--will be dumped; unfilteredoutput.txt is the serialized hashtable of
all possible tweet to adhoc retweets matched only by username and time, including false positives; 
filteredoutput.txt is a narrowed version that uses an arbitrary minimum longest common substring to
remove false positives.
