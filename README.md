To see the analysis code do something interesting, use the following command:

    python analysis.py ~/data/twitter/apr3-rt.bz2

The code reads the data and prints out some fields. For more information about
what can be found in the tweets, see the field guide
[https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects].
